#cobalt2
A Sublime Text theme based on our old blue friend cobalt.

Primarily a refined colour scheme that is easy on the eyes and takes small UI elements into account. See below for examples.

## Installation
Installation is easy, just follow these steps:

1. Open your Sublime Text packages directory `Preferences` → `Browse Packages`
1. Pop `cobalt2.tmTheme` into any directory in here. I like to put mine in the `Users` directory.
1. Activate under `Preferences` → `Color Scheme`
