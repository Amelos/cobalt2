#cobalt2
A Sublime Text theme based on our old blue friend cobalt.

Primarily a refined colour scheme that is easy on the eyes and takes small UI elements into account. See below for examples.

## Installation

Installation is easy, just follow these steps:  
1. Open your Sublime Text packages directory `Preferences` → `Browse Packages`  
2. Drop in the `Theme - Cobalt2` directory here  
3. Pop `cobalt2.tmTheme` into any directory in here. I like to put mine in the `Users` directory.  
4. Activate under `Preferences` → `Color Scheme` → `Cobalt2`  
5. Lastly, open `Preferences` → `Settings - User`, you should see ` "color_scheme": "Packages/User/cobalt2.tmTheme",` just add `"theme": "Cobalt2.sublime-theme",` directly underneath

While cobalt2 covers all languages, I write mostly JavaScript and CSS so I welcome any additions for other languages.
